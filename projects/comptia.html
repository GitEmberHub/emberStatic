            <p class="main">I came across the CompTIA's exams by chance one evening while investigating computer networks. I quickly learned of their reputation as foundational stepping stones for those entering the field of IT, and began to look into what the certifications entailed. CompTIA's A+ certification is known for demonstrating a wide range of technical proficiency. I had spent years digging into many of the covered topics, from hardware to software, operating systems to general troubleshooting. This would be the perfect test of the strengths I had been developing.</p>

          <div class="text-unit">
            <p class="main">The certification covers so much that it is probably fortunate that they had divided it into two seperate exams. Each attempt would come at a cost, so I was going to need a strategy. The difficulty of preparing for the A+ exam was that I as going in completely blind. CompTIA prohibits recounting test questions and have released none of the previous exams, so the testimony of past test-takers is all one has to guage its severity. Over-preparation seemed the best bet. I watched lengthy series from popular instructors to understand the breadth of the material, and took notes that I could review while periodically taking practice tests. AI helped clarify any answers I didn't understand. After about 2 weeks I was feeling confident and I scheduled my first test.</p>

            <p class="main">My results came after a 90-minute exam replete with interactive modules on troubleshooting and around 70 questions: I passed! This meant a lot to me, but I had to do the same thing all over again to complete the certification. I did my best to mimic my last preparations, drilling the topics for 2 more weeks, studying topics like networking protocols, virtualization, and security. After a similarly tough test, I passed the second test and was officially A+ certified! One step closer toward my goal of entering the IT industry.</p>
