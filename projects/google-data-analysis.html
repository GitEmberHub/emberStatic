            <p>In 2021, Google began offering its Data Analytics courses as a comprehensive introduction to statistical research and data visualization. In just 3 years over a million people had registered for the course, and I wasn't going to miss the boat! I had gotten my feet wet learning Python, and decided it would be a great way to gain some proficiency in the many tools they covered. The estimate time to finish each of the courses could be up to six months, but the entire course was self-paced.</p>

            <p>The first data analysis course aims to teach the fundamentals of R programming, SQL database manipulation, spreadsheets in Google Sheets (I preferred Excel), and dashboard visualization with Tableau. Along with these, they offer a thorough introduction to all things data, from acquisition to presentation. Each section of the course involves hands-on projects, and culminates in a test of the material. As someone who was looking for ways to be more functional with their programming, I really enjoyed learning about the capabilities of each tool. Understanding the extent of these possibilities still motivates me to keep learning.</p>

            <p>Google's second course kept up much of this momentum. Now that the students were acquainted with thinking about data, they'd pull no more punches. "Advanced Data Analytics" delved deeper into statistical tools and algorithms, touching on machine learning and fitting statistical models. In order to accomplish this, they also give a lengthy crash course on Python, including a breakdown of popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib, Seaborn, and sci-kitLearn. Even with a head start on the Python, this section proved to be intesive as the tools used were constantly multiplying. Learning about powerful concepts like regression models, K-means clustering and random forests made the payoff well worth it. Python's abstraction shines with these more complex ideas, making them accessible for programmers in their earlier stages like myself.</p>

            <p>The courses succeed in giving a comprehensive perspective of someone working in different data roles. They challenged me to think as a data analyst, combining creativity with modern machines to sift through data for insight. In addition, they were the first credentials of the kind that I've earned through programming, so I've decided to include them here on the site! I have no hesitation recommending the course for anyone interested.</p>
